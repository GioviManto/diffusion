"""Experiment 22 -- does the channel really destroy SHAPE information fastest?

The claim under test
--------------------
The note states that the OU channel destroys higher-order structure faster than second-order
structure, on the strength of `exp_06`: Fisher information for the innovation variance ``q``
falls 142x between t = 0.05 and t = 1.6 while information for the correlation ``rho`` falls
only 26x.

An external review showed this does not support the claim, and it is right. That experiment
runs in a **Gaussian** AR(1) with parameters ``(rho, q)``. Both are second-order: ``q`` is a
scale, not a shape. What was measured is that variance information decays faster than
correlation information -- interesting, but silent about higher-order structure, because the
model has no higher-order parameter to be informative about.

Two further problems the review identified, both fixed here:

  * ``g.T @ g / N`` is an empirical **outer-product** Fisher estimate, not observed
    information. Named accordingly below.
  * Comparing diagonal entries ignores nuisance coupling. If estimating shape requires also
    estimating ``rho`` and ``q``, the relevant quantity is the *efficient* information after
    projecting the nuisance directions out.

What this experiment does instead
---------------------------------
`src/shape_kernel.GeneralizedGaussianKernel` carries a genuine shape coordinate:

    p(e) propto exp( -(|e|/s)^beta ),   s(q, beta) chosen so Var(e) = q exactly.

``beta = 1`` is Laplace, ``beta = 2`` is Gaussian, and every member has the same variance, so
``beta`` moves the fourth moment while leaving the second fixed -- exactly the separation the
claim requires. Excess kurtosis runs 3 -> 0 across that range.

At each noise level we form the full 3x3 matrix for ``theta = (rho, q, beta)`` and report,
for each coordinate, both

    J[x, x]                          the raw diagonal, comparable to what exp_06 reported, and
    I_{xx . eta} = 1 / (J^{-1})[x, x]  the efficient information with the other two projected out,

since the second is what bounds the variance of any estimator that must also fit the
nuisance parameters. The difference between the two is the size of the mistake the old
comparison was making.

The headline number is the decay ratio of each coordinate's efficient information across the
schedule. Only if shape decays faster than correlation does the original sentence survive --
in a corrected form, and about a parameter that is actually higher-order.

This experiment deliberately does not fit anything. The information is evaluated at the truth
by Fisher's identity, one BP pass per chain, so nothing here depends on an optimiser.
