"""Diagnostics the revision needs and the existing outputs do not contain.

Three products, all cheap on one CPU, all written as CSV so the figures are
generated from committed data rather than from numbers typed out of prose.

1. ``boundary`` -- truncation diagnostic.
   The note previously carried a [pending] marker here: the boundary mass was
   computed inside the recursion and thrown away, so no aggregate could be
   quoted. For each (t, A, N_g) we run a forward pass over a batch of chains and
   record the fraction of each normalised message sitting in the two edge cells
   of the grid, taking the worst case over sites within a chain and then the
   maximum and upper quantiles over chains. This is an *empirical diagnostic* of
   how much mass approaches the truncation boundary, not a bound on the
   truncation error -- a distinction the first version of this file got wrong in
   both directions, by quoting one sampled trajectory and calling it a bound.

   Reported alongside it, and carrying most of the weight, is the quadrature mass
   of the kernel's own columns. That quantity involves no sample at all, and its
   split into edge and interior columns is what separates truncation (responds to
   A) from quadrature (responds to the spacing).

2. ``emtrace`` -- per-iteration marginal log-likelihood.
   ``outputs/exp_06/monotonicity.csv`` records only the first and last value, so
   monotonicity could be asserted but not plotted. ``fit_em`` already returns the
   whole trace; we persist it, for both the closed-form-M-step Laplace kernel and
   the generalised-EM mixture kernel, from several initialisations.

3. ``density`` -- the learned innovation law.
   Fits the mixture kernel at several data budgets and evaluates the fitted
   innovation density on a common grid, next to the true Laplace density. This
   is the direct picture of what is being estimated; the existing outputs record
   only its moments.

    """Boundary mass and normalisation residual over (t, A, N_g).

    Two quantities with different epistemic status, which the previous version ran together
    and the write-up then conflated.

    The **kernel column-mass residuals** are pure functions of ``(prior, A, N_g)``: no sample
    enters them at all. They are what separates truncation from quadrature, and they are
    deterministic, so they need no replication and were never affected by the seeding defect.

    The **forward-message edge mass** does depend on the observations, and it is a maximum
    over sites of a sampled trajectory -- a statistic a single draw systematically
    understates. It is therefore an *empirical diagnostic* over ``BOUNDARY_CHAINS`` chains,
    reported as a maximum and upper quantiles, not a bound. Calling one trajectory's value a
    truncation bound, as the earlier comment did, was wrong twice over: not a bound, and not
    a sample.
