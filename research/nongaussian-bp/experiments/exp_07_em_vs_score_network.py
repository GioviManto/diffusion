"""Experiment 07 -- Learning the denoiser: EM through BP vs a score network.

The claim under test is Marc's: that regressing a handful of BP parameters by
expectation maximization learns the denoiser far more efficiently than training
a network to represent it. "Efficiently" is not one number, so we measure four
and let them disagree where they do.

The two estimators target the *same* object, the posterior mean
m_i(x, t) = E[a_i | x], which fixes the score through the exact OU identity.

  EM-BP     learns the transition kernel K_theta of the clean chain by exact
            EM, then computes m by belief propagation. The learned object lives
            on R x R and carries no dependence on t whatsoever.
  DSM net   learns (x, t) -> m directly by denoising score matching, the
            vanilla diffusion recipe, with no knowledge that the chain is
            Markov.

Fairness. The comparison is set up to favour the network wherever there was a
choice:
  - Data budget is the number of *clean chains* N. The network trains on paired
    (a, x) with a fresh noise draw at every gradient step, so it may consume
    unlimited noise realizations of those N chains. EM sees one noisy
    realization of each chain, at one noise level, and never sees a clean chain.
  - Both are evaluated on the same held-out chains against the same reference:
    exact grid BP under the true prior.
  - The network's objective is the one whose minimizer is exactly the target,
    so it is not handicapped by a surrogate loss.
  - Both standard parameterizations are trained and reported: noise prediction
    ("eps", the usual diffusion recipe, which carries a sqrt(Delta_t)/alpha_t
    prefactor that suppresses network error at low noise) and clean-signal
    prediction ("x0"). Resting the comparison on whichever happens to lose
    would not be evidence of anything.

Part 1 (sample efficiency). Test error vs N, the headline curve.
Part 2 (capacity). Test error vs network size at fixed N, to check the network
  is not merely undertrained or too small -- the comparison must not hinge on a
  badly chosen architecture.
Part 3 (transfer across the noise schedule). Both methods evaluated at noise
  levels *outside* the training schedule. EM-BP has no schedule to leave: its
  parameters are properties of the clean chain, and BP supplies every t exactly.
  This part was written expecting the network to break outside its schedule.
  It does not: measured across t in [0.02, 3.2] there is no cliff at the
  boundary and the EM-BP advantage does not separate in-schedule from
  out-of-schedule levels. Time enters through smooth features and the target
  moves smoothly with t, so the network handles that direction adequately --
  the difficulty is in x-space. The part is kept because the negative result
  is worth having and because it does show the x0 parameterization failing
  outright at low noise.
Part 4 (cost accounting, honestly). Training seconds, parameter counts, and
  inference seconds per chain. The last one is where BP loses, and it is
  reported as prominently as the wins.

    """Part 1 again, with the parameterisation chosen on validation rather than on test.

    Part 1 emits `dsm_net_eps` and `dsm_net_x0` as separate rows and the better of the two
    is taken per noise level downstream. That is oracle post-selection on the evaluation
    set, and it favours the baseline rather than us: the network gets two attempts at every
    t and keeps the winner, while EM-BP gets one. The objection is real and cannot be
    answered by argument, only by measuring how much the oracle is worth.

    So: eps or x0 is chosen per noise level on a validation bundle drawn from `exp07-val`,
    disjoint from both the test bundle and every training seed, and only the winner is
    scored on test. Every row carries both numbers -- `*_selected` is the honest protocol,
    `*_oracle` is what part 1 reports -- so their ratio is the size of the selection bias.

    The fits are the *same models* part 1 evaluates: the RNG keys here are identical, so
    nothing differs between the two parts except which bundle the choice is made on. That
    is what makes the difference attributable to the protocol.

    Prediction, recorded before the run: removing an oracle only the networks enjoy should
    move the ratios in EM-BP's favour. If it moves them the other way, the validation
    bundle is too small for its selections to be anything but noise, and N_VAL is the knob.

    BOTH BUDGETS ARE NOW SELECTED, and that correction went the other way.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    An earlier version of this part selected EM-BP's iteration count on validation while
    the network trained to a fixed 20,000 steps. That is not a fair protocol, it is the
    same error in a new place: training length is a bias/variance knob for both arms --
    EM's held-out error has an interior minimum at every sample size (exp_29), and SGD's
    does too -- so tuning one arm's and pinning the other's favours the tuned one. It
    happened to favour us, which is precisely why it needed fixing rather than shipping.

    So the network's training length is now chosen on the same bundle, jointly with its
    parameterisation, from `net_checkpoints(n_steps)`. Each arm gets exactly one selected
    quantity: EM-BP its iteration count, the network its (parameterisation, length) pair.
    If anything the network still has the easier deal, since it selects over a
    two-dimensional grid and EM-BP over one.

    `*_at_cap` columns on both sides record what the pinned budgets would have given, so
    the effect of selection is measured on each arm separately rather than inferred from
    the ratio.
