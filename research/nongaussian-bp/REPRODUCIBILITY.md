# Reproducibility

Everything below was run on this branch. Paths are relative to
`research/nongaussian-bp/` unless stated otherwise.

## Environment

The package is pure NumPy/SciPy on CPU; CuPy is optional and only accelerates the batched
grid recursion.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Versions used for the committed outputs: Python 3.12, NumPy 2.4, SciPy 1.17, Matplotlib 3.10 —
except `outputs/exp_08_gradient_vs_exact_mstep/`, regenerated on 10 August 2026 under Python
3.12.5 / NumPy 2.5.2 / SciPy 1.18.0 after the trace-alignment fix. Its `params.json` records
the newer versions, so the difference is visible rather than implicit.
The HPC runs used Python 3.11 / NumPy 2.4 on Linux; provenance (Python, NumPy, platform,
hostname, SLURM ids, thread counts) is recorded in the `params*.json` beside every output
directory, so a number can always be traced to the machine that produced it.

GPU is optional. It requires `cupy<14` — CuPy 14's cub JIT fails against this cluster's headers —
with `CUDA_PATH` pointing at CUDA 12.4:

```bash
pip install "cupy-cuda12x<14"
export CUDA_PATH=/software/cuda/12.4
```

`src/backend.py` probes the GPU with a **matmul**, not an allocation: allocation succeeds on a
node with no working cuBLAS, so probing it would report a GPU that then fails mid-sweep.

## Quick check (about two minutes)

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
```

Expected: `236 passed, 12 skipped` (Python 3.12.5, NumPy 2.5.2, SciPy 1.18.0; ~2 min on four CPU
threads). The skips are the CuPy parity tests, which are skipped when no GPU is present. These tests are the evidence behind several numbers quoted in the note —
the brute-force enumeration check, the message-normalisation convention, the Fisher-identity
gradient check — so a failure here invalidates part of the write-up, not just the code.

## Regenerating the revision diagnostics

These three produce the outputs the revision added. Total about 30 minutes on one core.

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 python3 experiments/exp_18_revision_diagnostics.py --parts boundary
```
```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 python3 experiments/exp_18_revision_diagnostics.py --parts emtrace
```
```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 python3 experiments/exp_18_revision_diagnostics.py --parts density
```

Writing to `outputs/exp_18/{boundary,em_trace,innovation_density,innovation_summary}.csv`.

## Regenerating every figure

```bash
python3 paper/figures/make_figures.py
```

Reads only committed CSVs under `outputs/` and writes PDF and PNG into `paper/figures/`. It
exits non-zero and names the missing file if any input is absent, so a figure can never be
silently stale with respect to its data.

## Compiling the documents

Both compile with `tectonic` (used here) or a full TeX Live via `latexmk`.

```bash
cd paper && tectonic -X compile main.tex --keep-intermediates --outdir .
```
```bash
cd compendium && tectonic -X compile main.tex --keep-intermediates --outdir .
```

With TeX Live instead:

```bash
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error main.tex
```

The advisor documents are rendered from their Markdown sources:

```bash
python3 tools/md2tex.py EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md ANSWERS_AND_QUESTIONS_FOR_ADVISORS.md
```

## Report-quality experiments (local, hours)

Each script takes `--parts` to run a subset and writes to `outputs/<name>/`.

```bash
python3 experiments/exp_01_grid_validation.py
```
```bash
python3 experiments/exp_02_laplace_gaussian_message_error.py
```
```bash
python3 experiments/exp_06_em_parameter_recovery.py
```
```bash
python3 experiments/exp_07_em_vs_score_network.py --parts sample_efficiency,capacity,cost
```

## HPC (Bocconi)

Host `lnode01-da.hpc.unibocconi.it`, user `3164542`, project root
`~/nongaussian-bp`, dedicated venv. QOS caps are 30 submitted and 10 running per user, so
array sizes above 30 are rejected outright rather than queued.

Calibration must run and be inspected **before** the main generation sweep: the reference arm
does not reproduce the true innovation kurtosis at small step counts, so a comparison between
arms at an unvalidated step count measures the integrator rather than the score.

```bash
sbatch --array=0-5 --export=ALL,MODE=calibrate hpc/bocconi_exp16.sbatch
```
```bash
sbatch --array=0-15 --export=ALL,MODE=generate,NSTEPS=400 hpc/bocconi_exp16.sbatch
```
```bash
sbatch --array=0-4 --export=ALL,MODE=cpoint hpc/bocconi_cpoint.sbatch
```

The GPU script runs the CPU/GPU parity suite first and exits non-zero if it fails, so a sweep
cannot start on a node whose numerics disagree with the reference:

```bash
sbatch hpc/bocconi_gpu.sbatch
```

Pulling results back:

```bash
rsync -avz 3164542@lnode01-da.hpc.unibocconi.it:'~/nongaussian-bp/outputs/exp_16/' outputs/exp_16/
```

## Which output supports which claim

`paper/appendix.tex`, Appendix J, is the claim-to-script-to-output table, and
`REVISION_AUDIT.md` records the audit that produced it, including the one number found not to be
traceable to any committed run and what replaced it.
