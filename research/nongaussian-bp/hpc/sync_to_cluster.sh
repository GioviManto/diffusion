#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-11 two agents were syncing two different git
# worktrees into the same cluster directory, both with `rsync --delete`. Each
# deletion looked correct from inside its own branch: files belonging to the
# other branch are simply absent locally, so --delete removes them remotely.
# The EM branch lost src/wavelet.py, src/video_*.py and exp_23..exp_26; the
# wavelet branch lost exp_27_shape_convergence.py, src/clean_mle.py and
# hpc/bocconi_final_em.sbatch. In both cases a sweep was queued against a tree
# missing the files it calls, and one gate job failed for exactly that reason.
#
# So: NO --delete, ever, from this script. A stale extra file on the cluster is
# harmless. A deleted one costs a day of queue time and produces nothing.
#
#   ./hpc/sync_to_cluster.sh            # sync and verify
#   ./hpc/sync_to_cluster.sh --check    # verify only, exit 1 if anything is missing
