# Ship a reproducible source archive to the cluster. Replaces stamp+rsync.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The old path was two independent steps: `stamp_revision.sh` recorded the git
# state, then `sync_to_cluster.sh` rsynced the WORKING TREE. Nothing tied them
# together, so editing a file between them produced outputs whose stamp
# described a different program than the one that ran.
#
# That is not hypothetical. outputs/exp_12_scaled/*/params_*.json record
#
#     git_commit = 286b305...
#     overrides  = ["eff_seed0=0", ...]
#
# but 286b305's exp_12_receptive_field.py has no `eff_seed0` setting, and
# `apply_overrides` raises SystemExit on an unknown key. That command would
# have died instantly at that commit. The dirty list does not mention
# exp_12_receptive_field.py either, so the stamp was already stale when it was
# written. The source that produced those numbers is not recoverable.
#
# The fix is to make the archive the unit of deployment, so the thing that is
# hashed is the thing that runs:
#
#   1. refuse to build from a dirty tree             (no untracked drift)
#   2. `git archive` the commit                      (not the working tree)
#   3. SHA-256 the tarball                           (bytes, not beliefs)
#   4. extract on the cluster under the commit id    (no in-place overwrite)
#   5. outputs live OUTSIDE the source checkout      (a run cannot edit itself)
#
# Point 4 matters as much as the rest: the old script extracted over the
# previous deployment, so two half-synced revisions could interleave in one
# directory and no digest of anything would reveal it.
#
# Usage
#   hpc/deploy_clean.sh                 # deploy HEAD
#   hpc/deploy_clean.sh --allow-dirty   # scratch only; stamps source_is_clean=false
#
# Prints the remote source dir and the digest. Job scripts should source the
# emitted env file rather than hardcoding either.
