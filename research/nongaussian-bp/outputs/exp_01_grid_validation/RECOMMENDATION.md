Cheapest configuration with worst-case error < 1e-4 over tested t: M = 101, A = 4.

Caveats for the working default:
- This calibration is Gaussian; heavy-tailed innovations (Laplace,
  Student-t) put more posterior mass in the tails, so the half-width
  should NOT be reduced to the Gaussian-optimal value. We adopt
  M = 401, A = 8 as the reference configuration for all non-Gaussian
  experiments (error floor ~1e-15 in the Gaussian calibration, cost
  O(n M^2) still negligible), and M = 801, A = 8 for convergence checks.
- The binding constraint at very small t is the likelihood width
  sqrt(Delta)/alpha ~ sqrt(2t) versus the grid step 2A/(M-1); the
  `resolution_ok` column flags settings with < 3 grid points per
  likelihood standard deviation.
