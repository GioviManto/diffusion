"""CPU/GPU parity for the BP recursion.

This is the gate on every GPU number the project produces. The exactness claims -- grid BP
agreeing with the closed-form Gaussian score to 9.2e-15 and with brute-force enumeration to
1.0e-14 -- were all established on CPU. Running the same recursion on a different device with
different BLAS kernels and a different reduction order does not automatically preserve them.

So: no result computed on a GPU is trusted until these pass on that GPU.

The tests skip cleanly when no device is present, which is the normal state on a login node
or a laptop. A skip is not a pass, and the batch script runs them on the compute node before
the sweep rather than assuming a green laptop run means anything.

# siblings, per-depth grids of *different* sizes, and evidence at every node
# rather than only at the leaves. A device disagreement in any of those would be
# invisible to the tests above.
