"""The rotating ring: the port, the blindness theorem, and the normaliser.

Three things are pinned here.

1. **The port is faithful.** `src/ring.py` is a port of Problem 1 of
   `research/board-3problems`, which is independently audited against polar
   quadrature. The port must agree with it, not merely look like it.

2. **Marginal blindness holds.** Every single-frame marginal is psi-free. This
   is a theorem, so the test is an equality within Monte Carlo error, not a
   tolerance chosen to pass.

3. **The ring normaliser is present.** This is the one that matters most,
   because its absence is silent. Without `log_norm` the profile likelihood in
   `lam` increases without bound and the estimate pins to the top of whatever
   grid it is given -- smooth, confident, wrong. So there are two tests: the
   likelihood peaks at the truth, AND it does *not* when the normaliser is
   removed. The second exists so that deleting the term cannot make the suite
   greener.

    `_potential_loglik` sums over the rows of X, so an *absolute* plateau
    tolerance is a stricter convergence criterion the more data there is --
    eight times stricter at n=4096 than at n=512, for no statistical reason.
    Rung 4a reports how the error scales with n, so a stopping rule that is
    itself a function of n confounds the measurement with the budget. In the
    600-step sweep the marginal arm hit the cap in 95% of cells at t<=1 while
    the joint arm hit it in 57%, which made the arm comparison unreadable.

    Replicating the data k times multiplies the objective by k and leaves the
    gradient direction, the backtracking and hence the whole trajectory
    unchanged -- so the ONLY thing that can make the two fits stop at different
    steps is the stopping rule. Under a per-sequence tolerance they agree;
    under an absolute one the replicated fit sees k-times-larger improvements
    against the same threshold and runs longer.

    `plateau_tol` is passed explicitly and large, and both fits are asserted to
    have stopped BEFORE the cap. Without that guard the test is vacuous: at the
    default tolerance neither fit plateaus inside any affordable number of
    steps, both stop at the cap, and the two sizes agree no matter which rule is
    in force. That is exactly how this test passed against the defect it was
    written to catch, on 2026-08-17, before the guard was added.
