"""Local (convolutional) score heads: the receptive-field question, made concrete.

Ledger item B15 reads the Gaussian locality law as an architecture prescription:
a score head that sees only x_{i-r..i+r} should be near-optimal once
r >~ xi log(1/eps). That reading has always been classified HEURISTIC, because
nothing in the project ever trained such a head -- it was inferred from the
locality law (G12) and the truncated-inference result (B14).

This module builds the head so the prescription can be tested rather than
argued. A weight-shared window predictor

    m_i  =  f_phi( x_{i-r..i+r},  time features )

applied at every site is exactly a one-dimensional CNN with kernel width 2r+1
followed by pointwise layers, and r is its receptive-field radius. Sweeping r
turns "how big a receptive field does a score head need" into a measurement.

It also supplies the baseline the EM-versus-network comparison has been missing.
The vanilla MLP used in exp_07 is fully connected across sites and carries no
locality prior at all; a reviewer will reasonably ask whether an architecture
that *does* encode sequence structure closes the gap. This is that architecture,
and r = n recovers a global head for reference.

Boundary handling: windows are zero-padded, and every experiment also reports
the error restricted to interior sites (at least r from either end), because the
locality prediction is a statement about the interior. Reporting only the padded
number would confound receptive-field error with edge error.
