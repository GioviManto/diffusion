"""Exact BP on video: a temporal chain of spatial trees.

The structural question, stated precisely
-----------------------------------------
Video has two dependence structures, and the project already computes exactly on
each of them separately: a **spatial tree** per frame (`src/wavelet_bp.py`) and a
**temporal chain** across frames (everything else in the package). The tempting
claim is that the combination is therefore also exact. It is not, and the reason
is worth being exact about.

Take the *fully coupled* model: coefficient v in frame f depends on its scale
parent `p(v)` in frame f, and on itself in frame f-1. Then

    v_f -- p(v)_f -- p(v)_{f-1} -- v_{f-1} -- v_f

is a 4-cycle. The graph has loops, BP is loopy, and the exactness claim is gone.
Coupling every coefficient in both directions is exactly what one would want for
video, and it is exactly what cannot be done here.

What *is* loop-free is a spanning structure. The natural one couples the frames
only through the **root** of each frame's tree:

    root_1 --- root_2 --- root_3 --- ...        (temporal chain)
      |          |          |
    quadtree   quadtree   quadtree              (spatial, per frame)

Each root has one pendant subtree and at most two chain neighbours; the subtrees
are disjoint; there is no cycle anywhere. This is a "caterpillar": a chain
backbone with trees hanging off it. BP on it is exact, and the model it
corresponds to is a real one -- frames are temporally coupled at the coarsest
scale, and fine detail is temporally independent *given* the coarse trajectory.

That restriction is the price, and it should be stated rather than glossed:
this model cannot express a moving edge whose fine-scale detail persists
independently of the coarse content. It is the maximal tree-structured
spatio-temporal model of this shape, not the model one would write down if
exactness were not required.

How it is computed
------------------
Not with new inference code. BP on a caterpillar factorises into the two passes
the package already has:

1. run each frame's quadtree **upward**; the root's belief-up is then a single
   message summarising that entire frame;
2. run an exact **chain** BP over the frames with those messages as unary
   potentials;
3. feed each root's chain context back in as its incoming message and run each
   frame's quadtree **downward**.

Step 2 needs a chain BP over *arbitrary* unary potentials rather than Gaussian
likelihoods built from observations, which is the one genuinely new routine here.

    it.

    The result it establishes: **at most one temporal edge per connected

    Why this exists. §9.2 of the write-up establishes that at most **one**
    temporal edge per connected component is loop-free, so the caterpillar --
    with one component per orientation -- can couple only the root. The way to
    couple more is therefore not to add temporal edges to the same tree, which
    always closes a cycle, but to *cut* the tree into more components and give
    each its own. A spanning forest on F frames of n coefficients with c
    components has `Fn - c` edges, `F(n-c)` spatial and `c(F-1)` temporal, so
    the two are traded one for one against a fixed budget.

    Cutting below depth `cut` leaves `1 + b^cut` components per orientation: the
    top piece, plus one subtree under every depth-`cut` node. Each is itself a
    caterpillar, so this is composition rather than new inference -- and every
    point on the trade-off remains **exact**, which is the whole reason the
    curve is worth measuring instead of argued about.

    `cut = 0` is the plain caterpillar. `cut = depth` couples every leaf and
    keeps no spatial edge below the top piece.
