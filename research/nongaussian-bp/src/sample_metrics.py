"""Metrics for comparing a *generated* distribution against the true one.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Every comparison in the project so far has been *pointwise*: given the same noisy
observation ``x``, how far is one denoiser from another. Jerome's objection in the call of
29 July is that this is not the quantity diffusion is judged on::

    "the error on the score, the relationship between the score and the distribution of
     data that you end up generating at the end of the diffusion process, is not trivial,
     because you accumulate the errors of the scores, you go backwards, and not all times
     are equal."

A denoiser is used inside a reverse integration that calls it hundreds of times. Errors
compound, and they compound unevenly across the schedule: at small ``t`` the denoiser barely
acts (``alpha_t ~ 1``), at large ``t`` the noise dominates whatever it does, so it is the
intermediate times that govern the generated distribution. A pointwise error averaged over
``t`` cannot see any of that.

So this module measures the *output distribution*: draw samples by running the reverse
process under each score, and ask how the resulting law differs from ``p_0``.

The four metric families, and why all four
------------------------------------------
The project reports four things, and the reason is that they answer different questions and
have historically disagreed:

1. ``MSE(m_hat, m_star)`` -- distance to the Bayes-optimal denoiser. **Pure method error**:
   zero for a perfect method, no floor. This is the primary pointwise metric, and the one
   Jerome meant by "the posterior mean is the better metric".

2. ``MSE(m_hat, a)`` -- the actual denoising risk, i.e. the training loss. **Has an
   irreducible floor** at the Bayes risk ``E||a - E[a|x]||^2``. Reporting it without the
   floor is meaningless and has already produced one unsatisfiable test criterion in this
   project (a demand for >40% loss reduction when the arithmetic maximum was 39%).

3. Relative score error and cosine -- kept for continuity with Layers 2-5. **De-emphasised**,
   for a precise reason: by Tweedie,

       ||s_hat - s_star||  =  (alpha_t / delta_t) * ||m_hat - m_star||

   exactly (see ``metrics.score_mean_identity_residual``, which pins this to machine
   precision). So (1) and (3) are the *same measurement* under a known, strongly
   ``t``-dependent reweighting: ``alpha/delta`` runs from ~6.0 at ``t=0.08`` to ~0.09 at
   ``t=2.4``, a factor of 65 across the schedule. Score error silently upweights low noise.
   Both are reported so a reader can convert; neither is presented alone.

4. **Distributional metrics on generated samples** -- this module. What was actually asked
   for, and the only family that sees error accumulation.

Scope and honesty
-----------------
These are two-sample statistics computed from finite samples, so every one of them carries
Monte Carlo error, and a difference smaller than that error is not a difference. Each
function here therefore returns a bootstrap standard error alongside the estimate, and
``compare_distributions`` refuses to declare a winner when the intervals overlap. That is
deliberate: the project has twice reported a structure that a replicate count later
dissolved (the N^{-1/2} rate at 4 replicates, the kurtosis "convergence curve" at one
replicate per N).

    penalises a model for putting no mass where the truth has some, which is exactly the
    heavy-tail failure this experiment is looking for.

    Caveats, stated because a binned KL is easy to misread:

    * It is biased upward and the bias grows with ``n_bins``. Comparisons across methods are
      valid only at *fixed* binning, which is why the grid is derived from the reference
      sample alone and never from the sample under test.
    * Bins where the reference has no mass contribute nothing; bins where the reference has
      mass and the model has none would give infinity, so ``q`` is floored at one
      pseudo-count. The floor makes the number finite but means a catastrophic model is
