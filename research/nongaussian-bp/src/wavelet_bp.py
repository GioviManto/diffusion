"""Exact BP on a wavelet quadtree, where *every* node is observed.

Four things separate this from `hierarchy.tree_bp_grid`, and each is forced by
the data rather than chosen:

1. **Evidence at every node, not only at the leaves.** In `hierarchy` the
   internal nodes are latent and only the leaves are observed. A wavelet
   decomposition is invertible: every coefficient, at every scale, is part of
   the data, and the forward process noises all of them. So every node carries a
   likelihood factor. This changes nothing structurally -- one unary factor per
   site is exactly the situation under which the posterior factor graph equals
   the prior graph -- so BP is still exact. It only changes where `ell` is
   applied, and it means the downward message must exclude the child's upward
   message while *including* the parent's own evidence.

2. **A per-scale noise level.** Subband coefficient variances in natural images
   span orders of magnitude across scales, and one grid cannot resolve the
   finest while covering the coarsest. Each subband is therefore standardised by
   its own training scale s_d. That is a diagonal reparametrisation, so the
   likelihood stays an exact per-site Gaussian: from

       x_v = alpha a_v + sqrt(Delta) z_v,   xt_v = x_v / s_d,   at_v = a_v / s_d,

   one gets xt_v = alpha at_v + sqrt(Delta / s_d^2) z_v, i.e. the same alpha and a
   per-depth Delta_d = Delta / s_d^2. Nothing is approximated; the noise level is
   simply not the same number at every scale once the coordinates are rescaled.

3. **A per-depth *grid*.** This is what (2) forces, and getting it wrong is what
   confined an earlier version of this package to t >= 0.9. Because
   Delta_d = Delta_t / s_d^2, a subband with a *large* scale gets a *narrow*
   likelihood -- and in a natural image the largest scales are the coarsest
   subbands (LH depth 0 has scale 10.7 against 0.14 at HH depth 4, a factor of
   76). On a shared mesh those are the ones that go under-resolved, at small t,
   which is exactly where a reverse sampler spends its last steps.

   The fix is to spend grid points where the likelihood is narrow. It is close
   to free, because the coarse subbands are the ones with almost no nodes: level
   d holds 4^d nodes and wants M_d proportional to s_d, and since s_d roughly
   halves per level the product 4^d * M_d * M_{d+1} is nearly constant. Resolving
   down to t = 0.05 costs *less* than the old uniform M = 241 that only reached
   t = 0.9.

   `grids` and `weights` may therefore be lists, one entry per depth. Passing a
   single array keeps the old uniform behaviour, which is what the chain-derived
   tests still exercise.

4. **One kernel per scale.** Wavelet coefficients are not scale-stationary, so a
   single shared transition kernel is misspecified by construction. `log_k[d]`
   governs the edge from depth d to depth d+1 and is **(M_{d+1}, M_d)** -- child
   values down the rows, parent values across the columns. Every kernel in
   `src/kernels.py` accepts the two grids separately, so the per-level M-step is
   the existing M-step called once per level.

Convention, inherited unchanged from `src/bp_grid.py`: `log_k[d][k, j]` is
log K_d(u_k | u_j) with k the *child* value and j the *parent* value, so the
upward message is `K.T @ f` and the downward message is `K @ g`. Note which grid
each message lives on: a node's message *to its parent* is a function of the
parent's value, so it lives on the parent's grid.

Device
------
The recursion is parameterised by its array module, exactly as `src/bp_grid.py`
is, so the quadtree runs on a GPU from the same code path that runs on CPU --
see `src/backend.py` for why there is no second implementation. Until 19 Aug
2026 `backend` was wired into `bp_grid` and `denoiser` only, which meant the 1-D
chain work could use a device and *every image and video experiment could not*:
`BP_DEVICE=gpu` was silently a no-op for exp_23..exp_26.

Unlike `grid_bp_batch`, this returns **numpy** arrays whatever device it ran on.
The M-step, the model wrapper and every experiment downstream are host code, and
the results are small next to the work: posterior means are O(B x n_nodes) and
the per-level Xi are O(M_child x M_parent), against an O(B x n_nodes x M^2)
recursion. Converting at this boundary keeps every caller unchanged rather than
pushing device arrays into code that would then need its own port.
