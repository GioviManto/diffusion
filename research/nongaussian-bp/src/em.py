"""Tree-structured grid EM for chain-prior parameters, with belief propagation as
the E-step and exact or generalised kernel updates.

The name is deliberate and this module used to be called "Exact EM", which
overstated it in two directions at once. The E-step is exact *structurally* -- the
posterior really is a tree and sum-product really does return its marginals -- but
what runs is a truncated grid quadrature, so the numbers carry a discretisation
error. And the M-step is an exact maximiser only for the Gaussian and Laplace
kernels; the mixture and MDN kernels take conditional-maximisation sweeps, which
ascend Q without maximising it. "Exact" belongs to the continuous recursion, not
to this implementation of it.

Problem
-------
The clean data is a Markov chain whose transition kernel is *unknown*:

    p_theta(a) = mu(a_1) prod_{i=2}^n K_theta(a_i | a_{i-1}),

observed only through the OU channel  x = alpha_t a + sqrt(Delta_t) z. We are
given a sample {(x^(d), t_d)} and want theta. This is a latent-variable problem
(the clean chain a is never seen), so the natural estimator is maximum marginal
likelihood, computed by EM.

Why the E-step is structurally exact here
-----------------------------------------
The posterior p_theta(a | x) is again a chain: the likelihood factorizes
sitewise, so it only reweights the node potentials and leaves the edge
structure untouched. A chain is a tree, hence sum-product BP returns the
*exact* single-site and pairwise posterior marginals. There is no loopy-BP
approximation anywhere.

The remaining error is the grid representation of the continuous messages, and it
is measured rather than assumed. At M = 401, A = 8 the recursion agrees with the
Gaussian closed form to 9.2e-15 relative and with brute-force enumeration of the
discretised posterior to 1.6e-14 -- at that configuration, on those tests. That is
not a 1e-15 error bound for arbitrary kernels, tails or noise levels: trapezoidal
quadrature is O(h^2) and degrades when a likelihood is narrower than a few grid
cells, and the truncation diagnostic is a statistic over sampled chains whose
worst case at A = 8 is 1.2e-6, not its 90th percentile of 1.5e-8. See
frozen_config.half_width and experiments/exp_18_revision_diagnostics.py.

The one matrix that is the whole E-step
---------------------------------------
Write the grid as u_1..u_M with quadrature weights w, and let

    f_i = w * L_i * ell_i        ("forward message including its local factor")
    g_i = w * R_i * ell_i        ("backward message including its local factor")

for one chain. The pairwise posterior on edge (i, i+1) is

    b_{i,i+1}(u_j, u_k)  =  f_i(j) K[k, j] g_{i+1}(k) / Z_i,
    Z_i = g_{i+1}^T K f_i.

Every quantity EM needs is an expectation under these pairwise beliefs summed
over edges and over the dataset, so the entire E-step compresses into a single
M x M matrix

    C = sum_{d, i} g^{(d)}_{i+1} (f^{(d)}_i)^T / Z^{(d)}_i,      Xi = C * K,

with `*` elementwise. Xi[k, j] is the expected posterior mass placed on the
transition u_j -> u_k, summed over the whole dataset: exactly the continuous
analogue of the expected transition-count matrix of Baum-Welch.

Xi is a *complete summary for the current Q-function and M-step*: it does not
depend on how K_theta is parameterized, so the maximisation never revisits the
data, and sum(Xi) equals the number of edges in the dataset. It is NOT a
sufficient statistic of the observations, which is what calling it "a sufficient
statistic" unqualified suggests -- it is computed from the posterior at the
current theta, and so is conditional on that theta, on the model family, on the
grid, on the fixed initial law, and on the transition being homogeneous. Change
any of those and Xi changes.

Consequences used throughout this module:

1. The expected complete-data log-likelihood is a finite bilinear form,

       Q(theta | theta') = <Xi(theta'), log K_theta>  +  site-1 term  +  const,

   so the M-step never touches the data again -- only the M x M matrix Xi.

2. Fisher's identity gives the gradient of the *exact* marginal log-likelihood
   with no differentiation through the forward-backward recursion:

       grad_theta L(theta) = <Xi(theta), grad_theta log K_theta>.

   This is the key computational point: BP is not something we backpropagate
   through, it is the thing that supplies the expectation. No autodiff needed.

3. Cost per EM iteration is O(N n M^2), independent of the number of
   parameters, and the M-step is O(P M^2) with P = dim(theta).

    over the whole dataset followed by the kernel's own M-step.

    Stops early when the marginal log-likelihood increases by less than `tol`
    NATS PER TRANSITION, and only if it increased.

    The load-bearing change is the sign. The old test was

        abs(L_k - L_{k-1}) <= tol * abs(L_{k-1})

    which accepts a small DECREASE as though it were a small increase. Exact EM
    cannot decrease the evidence, so a decrease is a defect -- a broken M-step, or
    a generalised M-step overshooting -- and stopping on it reported the defect as
    success. The loop now requires a non-negative increment, records any decrease
    in `trace.monotone_violation`, and labels a run that never achieves a small
    non-negative increment as censored rather than converged.

    Normalising by `stats.n_edges` is a change of units, NOT a bug fix, and the
    distinction is worth stating because an external audit read it the other way.
    The old threshold was relative to the dataset total, and since dL and L are
    both sums over the same edges, dL/|L| is invariant under changing the sample
    size -- measured on the same law at 1x and 4x the data it agrees to every
    digit. So the old rule was already scale-free; it was not the n-dependent
    tolerance that had to be fixed in the ring experiment's plateau test. What
    per-transition units buy is interpretability: a constant threshold in nats per
    transition, rather than one that tightens over the run as |L| falls and that
    means something different at every noise level. At the budgets used here the
    default 1e-9 is far below the increments EM actually takes (~1e-4 per edge at
    iteration 30), so this guard rarely fires and the cap or the shape rule
    governs -- which is why the change is close to behaviourally inert.

    The returned kernel is always the one whose evidence is `trace.log_evidence[-1]`, and
    that alignment is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. An earlier version logged the
    evidence *before* each M-step and returned the parameters produced by the last one, so
    the kernel handed back was one update beyond anything that had been evaluated: its
    likelihood was never computed, the monotonicity check never covered the final step, and
    a caller comparing the reported evidence against a held-out number was comparing two
    different models. The loop below therefore evaluates each proposal after the M-step that
    produced it, and stops on the post-update value.
