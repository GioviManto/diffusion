"""Reverse-time samplers for the OU forward process.

Convention (matches src/noising.py)
-----------------------------------
Forward SDE:   dX_t = -X_t dt + sqrt(2) dW_t,  t in [0, T],  X_0 ~ p_0.
Marginals:     X_t ~ Law(alpha_t a + sqrt(Delta_t) z).

Reverse-time SDE (Anderson 1982), integrated from t = T down to t = t_min:

    dX = [ -X - 2 s(X, t) ] dt + sqrt(2) dW_bar        (dt < 0),

implemented in Euler-Maruyama form with step h > 0:

    x <- x + h [ x + 2 s(x, t) ] + sqrt(2 h) xi,   xi ~ N(0, I).

Probability-flow ODE (same marginals, deterministic):

    dX/dt = -X - s(X, t)    =>    x <- x + h [ x + s(x, t) ]   (backwards),

with an optional Heun (trapezoidal) corrector.

Because unit-variance data keep Var(X_t) = 1, we initialize at t = T with
X_T ~ N(0, I) (the T -> infinity limit; at T = 3 the bias is alpha^2 ~ 2.5e-3),
or from a forward-noised known sample for reconstruction experiments.

The final output can be read out either as x(t_min) or through the posterior
mean ("denoising readout")  m = (x + Delta_t s(x, t)) / alpha_t, which is exact
for BP-based scores since they are built from posterior means.

    Returns increments of shape ``(refine * (len(times) - 1),) + shape``, one per fine
    sub-step of the geometric grid obtained by splitting each coarse interval into `refine`
    equal parts in ``t``.

    Why this exists. `run_steps` currently integrates at 100, 200, 400 and 800 steps with
    *independent* noise at each resolution and compares the resulting marginal statistics.
    Those numbers came back non-monotone and all within one standard error of the target,
    which supports step-size **robustness** over the tested range -- but it is not a
    convergence study, and the write-up called it one. Independent noise means the difference
    between two resolutions is dominated by Monte Carlo scatter, not by discretisation.

    Nesting removes that. If the coarse increment over an interval is exactly the sum of the
    fine increments inside it, the two trajectories are driven by the *same* Brownian path
    and their difference is discretisation error alone, so a strong (pathwise) error can be
    measured and its order estimated. That is what distinguishes "the answer stopped moving"
    from "the noise is bigger than the movement".

    Use `coarsen_increments` to obtain the matching coarse increments from the same path.
