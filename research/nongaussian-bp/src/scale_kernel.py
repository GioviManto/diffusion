"""A transition kernel whose conditional *scale* depends on the parent.

Why this kernel exists
----------------------
Every kernel in `src/kernels.py` is linear-autoregressive,

    K(a' | a) = phi(a' - rho a),

so the parent's entire influence on the child is a shift of the innovation's
*location*: the conditional variance does not depend on `a` at all. On a chain of
simulated AR(1) data that is the right family, because it is the generating one.

On natural-image wavelet coefficients it is the wrong family, and
`experiments/exp_23_wavelet_statistics.py` measures by how much. Across the
finest scale boundary of CIFAR-10, a top-quartile-magnitude parent has children
2.9-3.6x more spread than a bottom-quartile one, in every orientation. And the
HH subbands, where that magnitude effect is strongest, have almost no *linear*
parent-child correlation (0.04-0.15). Fitted with a linear-AR kernel, HH would
return rho ~ 0 and collapse to a factorised heavy-tailed model: good marginals,
no hierarchy at all.

This is the continuous-density form of the classical wavelet hidden Markov tree
(Crouse, Nowak, Baraniuk 1998), whose hidden state is exactly a "this
coefficient is large / small" indicator passed from parent to child. There the
tree is Markov in the hidden *state*; here it is Markov in the value, which is
what the package's grid BP requires, so the state is marginalised into the gate:

    K(a' | a) = sum_c w_c(a) N(a'; rho_c a, sigma_c^2),
    w_c(a)    = softmax_c(beta_c + gamma_c a^2).

The quadratic-in-`a` logit is not an arbitrary choice: `softmax_c(beta_c +
gamma_c a^2)` with `gamma_c = -1/(2 tau_c^2)` and `beta_c = log pi_c - 0.5 log
tau_c^2` *is* the posterior responsibility of a zero-mean Gaussian scale mixture.
So the gate is the exact form the scale-mixture story implies, with `C` mixture
components costing `4C` parameters per level.

The M-step
----------
ECM with the component label as the inner latent variable, exactly as
`MixtureInnovationKernel` does. Given the responsibilities

    R_c(k, j) = w_c(u_j) N(u_k; rho_c u_j, sigma_c^2) / K(u_k | u_j),

the `rho_c` and `sigma_c^2` blocks are closed-form weighted least squares. The
gate block is *not* closed form: maximising `sum_{j,c} n_c(j) log w_c(u_j)` is a
multinomial logistic regression on the feature `(1, u_j^2)` with soft counts. It
is concave, so gradient ascent with a backtracking line search reaches an
increase every time, which is all generalised EM needs -- the same ECM framing
the project already uses, and monotone ascent is preserved rather than assumed.

    reproduces that has captured the structure, and one that returns an excess
    near 1 has not -- whatever its held-out likelihood says.
