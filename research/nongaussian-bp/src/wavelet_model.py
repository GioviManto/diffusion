"""The wavelet hidden-Markov-tree model: fitting it, scoring with it, sampling from it.

This is the assembly layer. `src/wavelet.py` supplies the transform and the tree
indexing, `src/wavelet_bp.py` supplies exact inference, `src/kernels.py` supplies
the M-step; what is left is the bookkeeping that turns them into a model of
images.

Three decisions are recorded here rather than buried:

**Per-subband standardisation.** Each subband is divided by its training
standard deviation s_d, which turns the single pixel-space Delta_t into a
per-depth Delta_d = Delta_t / s_d^2. See `src/wavelet_bp.py` for why that is an
exact reparametrisation and not an approximation. The s_d are estimated once, on
the training split, and stored on the model: they are parameters, and using test
statistics for them would leak.

**One kernel per scale, shared across orientations.** Coefficients are not
scale-stationary, so a shared kernel is misspecified. Whether HL, LH and HH need
*separate* kernels is an empirical question, so `tie_orientations` is a flag and
the default (True) is the more constrained model, which is the one that should
have to be beaten.

**The LL coefficient is modelled separately.** It is a single scalar per image,
disconnected from all three trees. Modelling it as a one-dimensional density
costs nothing and keeps the tree model honest: no part of the image is quietly
dropped, and the held-out likelihood is a likelihood of the whole image.

    one kernel is a denoiser at *every* noise level, so the training set should
    exercise several.

    `kernel_factory(depth_index, rng)` returns a fresh kernel for one edge level.

    Grids. Pass `t_resolve` to size a **per-depth** mesh that resolves the
    likelihood down to that diffusion time (the default, at the smallest t in
    `t_train`). Pass `grid_size` instead to force one uniform mesh everywhere,
    which is what the pre-per-depth results used and is kept for comparison.
    Passing both is refused rather than silently resolved.

    Device. `xp=None` reads `BP_DEVICE`. The E-step is the whole cost -- three
    orientations x len(t_train) exact tree passes per iteration -- and it is what
    moves to the GPU; the M-step stays on the host, where its operands are the
    per-level Xi (M_child x M_parent) rather than anything batch-sized. The
    resolved device is printed under `verbose` because `get_xp` falls back to
    numpy with a warning when no device is usable, and a fit that took the
