"""Emit the convergence-rate macros into overleaf/shared/sections/.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Table~\\ref{tab:pointwise} reports a ratio rising from 7.0 to
17.6 and the prose says "rising with nseq" without quantifying it. A ratio at one
size is a point comparison, and the obvious objection to a point comparison is
that it reflects tuning. A *rate* difference is a different kind of claim: it says
the gap widens with sample size, so no amount of tuning at one size explains it.
The data already on disk supports the stronger statement, and this measures it.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED. This fits log--log slopes over the measured range,
nseq = 32 to 4096. It is not an asymptotic statement, and the macros are named so
that the prose cannot accidentally make one: `\\rateem` is "the fitted slope over
the measured range", not "the rate". Seven doublings with both arms partly
budget-censored is not the regime in which to assert an asymptotic exponent.

THE CENSORING, WHICH IS THE ONLY SERIOUS OBJECTION. Both arms increasingly select
their largest allowed budget as nseq grows -- the network from 6% of cells at
nseq=32 to 42% at 4096, EM--BP from 12% to 61%. By the project's own rule (a
budget is a regularisation knob, so two arms with different cap-hit rates are
being compared on budgets rather than methods) that is disqualifying unless its
direction is known.

It is known, and it is conservative. The paired budget calibration at nseq=2048
-- same seeds, same bundles, both caps tripled -- lowers the network's error by
0.35% and EM--BP's by 4.5%, so EM--BP is the arm being held back. Because its
cap-hit rate *rises* with nseq, the censoring inflates its error more at large
nseq than at small, which makes its measured curve SHALLOWER than the truth.
Removing the censoring would therefore steepen EM--BP's slope and widen the gap.
The measurement is a lower bound on the effect it reports.

Aggregation is per seed, as in make_tab_efficiency.py, and for the same reason:
cells within a seed share a training set and move together.
