"""The capacity-equivalence table: does mixture capacity actually saturate at C=8?

WHY THIS EXISTS. Chapter 9 reported held-out evidence at C in {2,4,8,16} paired
against C=1, six seeds, one training size, one initialisation per cell. C=8 and
C=16 differed by 5e-6 and an early draft read that as saturation. Round-two
review was right that this is a failure to resolve rather than a demonstration
of equivalence: six seeds with no predeclared equivalence region cannot establish
a null it was never positioned to test. The chapter was corrected to say exactly
that, and exp_32 was built to let the stronger claim be made honestly IF the data
supported it -- sixteen paired seeds, two sizes, three initialisations selected
on validation, three metrics, and an equivalence region fixed before the contrast
was computed.

The data do not support it, and they do not support the opposite of it either in
the shape anyone expected. At nseq=128 the C=8 -> C=16 step is RESOLVED, and in
the direction of C=16 being worse: held-out evidence falls and schedule-level
score risk rises, with both bootstrap intervals lying entirely outside the
predeclared region. At nseq=512 both intervals straddle zero. So the honest
reading is neither "saturates by eight" nor "keeps paying past eight": past the
capacity the data supports, extra components cost.

THE CAVEAT THAT HAS TO TRAVEL WITH IT. Every cell at C >= 4 stopped at the
em_cap of 1200 rather than at the tolerance -- `em_converged` is False for all
96 of them and the median `em_iters_used` is the cap. The experiment's own
docstring records why the cap sits there: a representative C=16 fit run to 2000
iterations has per-edge gain 6.9e-8 at 400, ~6e-9 by 800, and then plateaus
(6.08e-9 at 1200, 5.92e-9 at 1600, 6.09e-9 at 2000), never crossing the strict
1e-9 threshold at any practical count. The cap targets that plateau, not the
formal tolerance. That makes the residual convergence asymmetry small rather than
absent, and the section reports it rather than claiming it away.
