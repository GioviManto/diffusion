"""The structured-baseline table: EM-BP against the winning structure-aware
network (Section 9.2 of the thesis / Appendix N of the paper).

WHY THIS EXISTS. The headline table (tools/make_tab_efficiency.py) compares
EM-BP against a fully connected MLP and reports 7-18x. The MLP carries no
locality prior and no weight sharing, so the single most obvious objection to
that number is that it measures the architecture's mismatch to sequence data
rather than the value of knowing the Markov structure. This table answers it.

This is the SECOND generation of this table. The first read outputs/exp_12_scaled/,
whose provenance turned out not to verify (a recorded commit that does not
define an override its own command passes -- outputs/README_exp12_scaled.md
has the detail) and whose protocol differed from the headline table's in four
ways (center-site-only scoring, a shorter chain, five noise levels instead of
twelve, a fixed step budget). exp_31_structured_baseline.py is the corrected
replacement named as pending everywhere that table's numbers were disclaimed:
same protocol throughout, all-site AND predeclared-interior scoring alongside
the centre-site diagnostic, both arms checkpointed and selected on a
validation bundle disjoint from test, deployed and gated through
hpc/deploy_clean.sh so provenance is verified rather than assumed. It runs a
screening stage on development seeds to pick the strongest of three
architectures (weight-shared window, dilated convolution, bidirectional
message passing) and a confirmatory stage, at the headline protocol, on the
full sixteen frozen seeds.

Aggregation follows the headline table: average within a seed first (the
noise levels share a training set and a fitted model, so they are not
independent), then across seeds, paired per seed since both arms are fit on
the same data. Region 'all' is the honest all-site metric this table exists
to supply; 'centre' is kept for continuity with the retired table and is
never the headline.
