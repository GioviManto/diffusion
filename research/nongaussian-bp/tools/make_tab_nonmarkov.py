"""Emit the non-Markov robustness table from the frozen outputs.

Written because the hand-typed version could not be reproduced. The compendium
quotes 18.3 for (Gaussian, vs CNN, beta=0); averaging `ratio_to_em` over t in
outputs/exp_21/gauss_beta0.0 gives 10.76, the median gives 11.43, and no single
t exceeds 14.21. The gamma rows are near but not equal (published 24.1, 1.19,
0.98, 0.86, 0.77 against computed 20.94, 1.24, 1.03, 0.85, 0.76), which is the
signature of a different RUN rather than a different aggregation. Whatever its
provenance, a table nobody can regenerate from the committed outputs is not
evidence, and this is the one table in the document that was still typed.

Source is the FROZEN rerun (array 633406), not the original (627165). The
original used em_iters=80 and net_steps=8000 against the frozen protocol's 400
and 20000, so its BASELINE was trained on 40% of the budget with no checkpoint
selection. Undertraining the baseline inflates every ratio in the table, and it
is the one direction of error that would not survive review -- so the numbers
here come from the rerun and the original is kept only for the comparison in the
docstring below.

What the rerun changed, beyond making the numbers quotable:

  * beta=0 and gamma=0 are the SAME configuration -- no contamination, a pure
    Markov chain. At the old budget they gave 10.76 and 20.94, a factor of two
    apart. At the frozen budget they give 16.41 and 16.07, agreeing to 2%. The
    uncontaminated control now reproduces across two independent runs; before,
    it did not, and that alone should have blocked the table.
  * The old beta sweep ran 10.76 -> 31.47 -> 8.27 -> 3.44 -> 2.43. Contamination
    appeared to HELP at beta=0.1, which is not physical. The rerun gives
    16.41 -> 14.84 -> 6.68 -> 3.21 -> 2.16, monotone.

The qualitative conclusion is unchanged and is what the section should lead with:
rank-one contamination is survivable, long-range coupling is not, and the
crossover sits at gamma ~ 0.10.
