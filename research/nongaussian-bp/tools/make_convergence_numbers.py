"""How many EM iterations each coordinate of the fit actually needs.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Three documents carried the sentence "the fitted innovation
shape needs on the order of 2000 iterations to settle." Nothing measured that.
The number came from a diagnostic in exp_32 that ran a representative C=16 fit
OUT TO 2000 iterations to show its per-edge gain had plateaued and would never
reach the strict tolerance -- a statement about where the gain flattens, not
about where the shape stops moving. The two got conflated, and the conflated
version was then used to justify withdrawing the generative-fidelity claim and
to set the capacity design's budget.

The actual measurement is exp_27, and it is an order of magnitude smaller: the
shape settles at a median of ~230 updates with a tail to ~640, against ~80 for
the correlation coefficient. The conclusions all survive -- a 40-iteration
budget is still far short of 230, so the generative comparison was still
under-converged on the one coordinate it scored -- but the factor was wrong by
about ten, and a factor wrong by ten in a thesis is worth one generator.

`settle_X` in that experiment is the first update after which coordinate X stays
within a relative tolerance of its final value (rho 1e-3, innovation variance
1e-2, excess kurtosis 2e-2). Because "final" means the value at the end of the
run, the statistic is censored by run length: a coordinate still drifting at the
cap reports a settling time near the cap. The sweep has two run lengths, and only
the longer one is uncensored, so the headline numbers come from that shard and
the censored one is reported as the lower bound it is.
