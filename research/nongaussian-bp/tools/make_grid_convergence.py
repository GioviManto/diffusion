"""Grid and domain convergence over the schedule actually used, not one point.

WHY THIS EXISTS (review Priority 5). The discretisation control in the paper
rests on two things: a Gaussian configuration where the closed form is known and
the grid reproduces it to ~1e-14, and a self-convergence check at one family,
one noise level, one draw. Both are real. Neither covers the regime the
production runs are in.

The Gaussian check is unusually benign -- a smooth, light-tailed kernel whose
messages stay Gaussian, so the quadrature never has to represent a shape the
recursion created. The regimes that could actually bite are the ones it avoids:
heavy tails, the smallest Delta_t where the likelihood is narrowest relative to
the mesh, tail observations, and the narrowest fitted mixture component. Quoting
1e-14 without saying which configuration produced it invites the reader to
believe it is a uniform bound. It is not, and the appendix now says so; this is
the measurement behind that admission.

It also supplies the evidence for a second claim. The recursions are scaled
linear-domain, not log-domain, so total message mass is preserved but individual
entries can underflow to zero. `zero_frac` below measures how often that
actually happens across the schedule.

Diagnostics per configuration, all against a finer reference:

    score_rel    relative score error vs the reference grid
    dlogev       log-evidence shift per site vs the reference
    boundary     fraction of forward-message mass in the outermost 2% of the
                 domain -- the truncation diagnostic
    zero_frac    fraction of likelihood entries that underflowed to exactly 0
