# MANUSCRIPT CONSISTENCY GATE for the paper. Not an honesty gate.
#
# The distinction is worth stating, because this script was described as the
# latter and it cannot be. What it checks is that the document is internally
# consistent with its own outputs: no placeholders, no orphaned section files,
# every efficiency figure coming from a generated macro rather than being typed,
# no duplicated scientific constants, the body inside its page budget. Those are
# real and they catch a real failure -- a number drifting between the prose and
# the table it came from.
#
# What it CANNOT check, and what nobody should read a green run as certifying:
# whether the baselines are strong enough to support the comparison; whether a
# budget was right-censored; whether validation leaked into test; whether every
# figure uses the correct statistical unit; whether an exclusion rule favours
# one arm; whether a theorem's hypotheses match the prose around it; or whether
# a GPU test actually executed rather than skipping.
#
# One rule here is especially easy to misread. The check forbidding correction
# and withdrawal language in main.tex enforces that the PAPER does not carry its
# own errata -- corrections belong in the compendium's claim audit. It does not
# verify that a withdrawn claim has actually left every dependent figure and
# conclusion. That verification is the claim ledger's job, and the ledger is a
# document maintained by hand, not a script.
#
# Run from the repository root:
#
#     tools/check_paper.sh
#
# Exits non-zero if any check fails. Intended for CI and for the final build.

# Both production documents are gated. The compendium is the development
# environment and is deliberately NOT gated -- it is where unfinished work is
# allowed to live.
#
# The paper limit stays at NINE, the NeurIPS main-body allowance, and the
# 2026-08-23 review was absorbed without relaxing it. That review required
# content the paper did not have -- Proposition 2 with its hypotheses rather
# than gestured at, a corrected account of why the closure gap closes (the
# noised marginal Gaussianises; the posterior does not), the discrete/continuum
# scope on Fisher's identity, and a baseline that shares the data's structure --
# roughly a page in total. It was accommodated by moving the proofs, the
# hypothesis discussion and the structured-baseline table into the appendix,
# which is where they belong anyway, rather than by moving the line.
#
# Worth keeping the reasoning: a length gate that gets raised whenever it binds
# measures nothing. If the body genuinely needs more room, the argument to have
# is about what leaves the body, not about what the limit is.

# 4b. Every section file must be reached by at least one production document.
#
#     The rule used to be "reached by BOTH", which was right while the workshop
#     was a compression of the paper. It is not right now that the workshop is a
#     strict subset -- the efficiency table and Fisher's identity are the paper's
#     alone -- and a gate that demands the impossible is a gate people switch off.
#     What still matters is that no section is orphaned: an unreached file is a
#     copy nobody compiles, so it drifts from whatever superseded it and is then
#     available to be pasted back in. That is exactly how the stale ring model
#     (missing its normaliser) outlived the corrected one in the compendium.
#     Scanned over every file a production document actually compiles, not just
#     the two roots. Grepping main.tex alone called three files orphaned that
#     were included from paper/appendix.tex and from the compendium -- a false
#     positive that pushes toward deleting live content, which is the opposite
#     of what this check is for. The compendium counts as a consumer here: it is
#     not gated for length or polish, but a shared section it compiles is not an
#     uncompiled copy, which is the thing being guarded against.
