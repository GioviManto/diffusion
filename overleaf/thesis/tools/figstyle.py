"""Figure conventions for the thesis.

One place for palette, sizing, and saving, so that every figure in the document
looks like it came from the same hand. Three rules the old figures broke:

  * legends never sit inside the data area (they collided with tick labels in
    the three-panel EM diagnostics and with the curves in the non-Markov panel);
  * panels are laid out by ``constrained`` and never by ``tight_layout``, which
    is what let the third panel's y-axis labels be overdrawn;
  * widths are fixed to the thesis text block, so no figure is ever rescaled by
    LaTeX and the type size is the same in all of them.

Nothing here writes to ``overleaf/shared/figures``. The thesis carries its own
copies in ``overleaf/thesis/figures`` so that restyling it cannot disturb the
paper, the workshop note, or the compendium.
